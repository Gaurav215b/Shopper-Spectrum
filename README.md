🛒 Shopper Spectrum: Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendations in E-Commerce
Shopper Spectrum is a data-driven Streamlit app designed to help retailers analyze customer behavior and enhance product offerings.

It provides two core modules:

🔹 1. Customer Segmentation

🔴 At-Risk

This allows retailers to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer retention.

🔹 2. Product Recommendation
Implements item-based collaborative filtering using cosine similarity to recommend the top 5 most similar products based on historical purchasing behavior.
